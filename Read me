The project here contains the baseband simulation of the satellite communication system in DVB-S and DVB-S2 standards. Also explore the performance of modulation schemes and coding rate.
The wireless channel simulated here is mainly the AWGN channel, Rayleigh fading channel will also br explored in the DVB_S2 standard.
